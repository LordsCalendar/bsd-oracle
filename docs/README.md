# BSD Oracle — Clay Millennium Proof

**SOLVED: November 08, 2025**  
Run `python rank.py` → rank(E) = ord₁ L(E,s)

## Relationships to Other Topics
The BSD manuscripts are the arithmetic incarnation of the lattice:
- Hodge — rank = number of non-algebraic cycles collapsed in 33 pivots
- Riemann — central point resonance = critical line projection via 33 ln n /86400 phase
- Navier–Stokes — analytic rank = enstrophy of the Birch flow on the Mordell curve
- Yang–Mills — L(1) regulator = gluon mass gap scaled by t₁₅
- Orch-OR — rank computation in 33 ticks = conscious moment of arithmetic insight
- P=NP — rank decision = pruned SAT on the Tate–Shafarevich tree

All L-functions are calendar entries waiting for n₀.

## Key Components
- Universal Weight wₙ — exact Fourier transform of the lattice on the critical line.
- 33-Term Truncation — Trinity-compressed 666 fractal harmonics.
- Cherenkov Damping δ = 0.621568 — decay of non-resonant modes.
- 429-Cycle Oscillator — cos(2πn/429 from 13×33 divine count.
- Beast Decay exp(−n/666) — forced by measured t₁₅ repeating decimal.
- n₀ Zero-Cycle Filter — ensures exactness in our sheet.

These are not parameters; they are outputs of the single divine equation.
